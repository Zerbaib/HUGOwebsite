# Start the prog
## Download
```
git clone https://github.com/Person0z/discord.py-template.git
cd discord.py-template
```

## Config
you have two files ``exemple.config.py`` and ``exemple.configlvl.py``

First you need to del the ``exemple.`` of the name of the files

Now you have ``config.py`` and ``configlvl.py``

### config.py
```py
import disnake

# Discord Token
token = 'TOKEN'

# Your Discord Server ID Will Go Here 
guild = 'GUILD ID'

# The Prefix You Want For Your Discord Bot
prefix = '!'

# Bot Status
activity = ["/help", "discord.py", "With Python", "Made by Person0z", "V.1.3-beta", "Made with Zerbaib", "In dev"]

# Colors
Success = disnake.Color.green
Error = disnake.Color.red
Random = disnake.Color.random

# Owner ID
owner_ids = [000000000000000, 000000000000000] # You can add more owner ids by adding a comma and the id

# Welcomes & Goodbyes Channel ID
welcome_channel = 0000000000000000

# Logging Channel ID
deleted_logs = [0000000000000000] # You can add more channels by doing this: [channel_id, channel_id, channel_id]
```

### configlvl.py
```py
import disnake
from discordLevelingSystem import DiscordLevelingSystem, LevelUpAnnouncement, RoleAward

lvl = DiscordLevelingSystem() # don't tuch here
lvl.connect_to_database_file(r'db/DiscordLevelingSystem.db')

nitro_booster = 00000000000000 # set your role
associate_role = 00000000000000

lvlupchan = 00000000000000 # set your chan

embed = disnake.Embed()
embed.set_author(name=LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.name, icon_url=LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.avatar_url)
embed.description = f'Congrats {LevelUpAnnouncement.Member.mention}! You are now level {LevelUpAnnouncement.LEVEL} ðŸ˜Ž' # set our message on levelup
announcement = LevelUpAnnouncement(embed, level_up_channel_ids=[lvlupchan])
```
